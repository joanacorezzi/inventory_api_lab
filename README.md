# Inventory Management System - Python REST API with Flask

This is a simple Inventory Management System built for a Python summative lab assignment.  
It includes:

- A Flask-based REST API (CRUD operations)
- Integration with an external API (OpenFoodFacts)
- A CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to interact with the API
- Unit tests for API, CLI, and external API interactions

Everything is kept basic and beginner-friendly.
